## Versioning
- For the startegy we chose Versioning through URI Path, as for the middleware we used totoro-node.

Totoro is a Node.js module to help simplify route management and reduce code duplication for multiple API versions.

This module allows us to easily define multiple API versions which can inherit endpoints from previous versions or override the functionality of an endpoint in a subsequent version of the API.
to install totoro-node:
```
npm install totoro-node
```
